# Realtime Channel Utility Analysis

## Current Implementation (`/app/src/lib/supabase.ts`)

### Overview
The `createRealtimeChannel` utility is designed to manage Supabase realtime subscriptions with error handling and retry logic. However, it has several critical issues.

### Key Components

#### 1. Singleton Supabase Client
```typescript
let supabaseInstance: ReturnType<typeof createSupabaseClient> | null = null;

export const createClient = () => {
  if (supabaseInstance) {
    return supabaseInstance;
  }
  supabaseInstance = createSupabaseClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
  return supabaseInstance;
};
```

**Analysis**: This is correct - prevents multiple client instances.

#### 2. Active Channels Tracking
```typescript
const activeChannels: Record<string, RealtimeChannel> = {};
```

**Analysis**: Global state to track active channels by ID.

#### 3. Channel Creation Logic
```typescript
// Always clean up any existing channel with the same ID first
if (activeChannels[channelId]) {
  console.log(`Cleaning up existing channel: ${channelId}`);
  const existingChannel = activeChannels[channelId];
  try {
    existingChannel.unsubscribe();
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn(`Error unsubscribing from existing channel ${channelId}:`, e);
  }
  delete activeChannels[channelId];
}
```

**CRITICAL ISSUE #1**: This approach is fundamentally flawed for React components.

### Problems Identified

#### Problem 1: React Component Lifecycle Mismatch
- **Issue**: The utility always destroys existing channels, even if they're working fine
- **Root Cause**: React components can re-render multiple times, especially in Strict Mode
- **Impact**: Each re-render destroys and recreates channels, causing subscription failures

#### Problem 2: Subscription State Management
```typescript
let hasSubscribed = false;
```

**Issue**: This local variable doesn't persist across function calls. Each time `createRealtimeChannel` is called, `hasSubscribed` resets to `false`.

#### Problem 3: Race Conditions
- **Scenario**: Component mounts → creates channel → component re-renders → destroys channel → creates new channel
- **Result**: The first channel might still be in the process of subscribing when it gets destroyed
- **Impact**: "tried to subscribe multiple times" errors

#### Problem 4: Error Handling Logic
```typescript
} catch (error: any) {
  console.error(`Error subscribing to channel ${channelId}:`, error);
  hasSubscribed = false;
  if (onError) onError(error as Error);
  delete activeChannels[channelId];
}
```

**Issue**: When an error occurs, the channel is deleted from tracking, but the actual Supabase channel object might still exist and attempt to subscribe.

### React Strict Mode Impact

React's Strict Mode (enabled by default in development) intentionally:
1. Mounts components twice
2. Runs effects twice
3. This causes `createRealtimeChannel` to be called multiple times rapidly

**Current Flow in Strict Mode**:
1. First mount: Create channel A, start subscription
2. Strict Mode unmount: Cleanup runs
3. Second mount: Destroy channel A (even if working), create channel B
4. Channel A might still be trying to subscribe → "multiple subscription" error

### Proposed Solutions

#### Option 1: Make Channels Truly Reusable
- Don't destroy working channels
- Check channel state before deciding to reuse or recreate
- Implement proper reference counting

#### Option 2: Channel Factory Pattern
- Create a factory that manages channel lifecycle
- Use React refs to persist channels across re-renders
- Implement proper cleanup only on actual unmount

#### Option 3: React Hook Integration
- Create a custom hook that properly integrates with React lifecycle
- Use useRef to persist channel instances
- Use useEffect cleanup for proper unsubscription

### Recommended Approach

**Option 3** is recommended because:
1. Integrates naturally with React patterns
2. Handles Strict Mode correctly
3. Provides proper cleanup semantics
4. Easier to debug and maintain

### Next Steps

1. Analyze how the lobby component uses this utility
2. Document the exact sequence of calls causing issues
3. Implement a React hook-based solution
4. Test with React Strict Mode enabled
