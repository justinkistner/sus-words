## 🎭 **Game Mode Variations**

### 1. **Double Agent Mode**

* **Two fakers** are chosen.
* They don’t know who the other faker is.
* Adds an extra layer of bluffing and chaos—can they avoid exposing each other?

---

### 2. **Silent Round**

* No verbal/written clues allowed.
* Players must **use emojis or images** to give their hint.
* Forces creative interpretation and misdirection.

---

### 3. **Reverse Mode (Spyfall-style)**

* Only the **faker knows the word**.
* Everyone else has to figure it out through their clues.
* If they figure it out, they score. If they guess wrong, the faker wins.

---

### 4. **Time Bomb Mode**

* Each player has **10 seconds to give their clue**.
* If they don’t respond in time, they’re auto-skipped (and look suspicious).
* Adds pressure and humor.

---

### 5. **Decoy Word Mode**

* Everyone sees the same grid, but **some players (not the faker)** are assigned a **different but similar word** (e.g. "cat" vs "tiger").
* Now it's not just “who doesn’t know?” but also “who is subtly off?”

---

### 6. **Truth or Trap**

* Everyone gives **two clues**: one that’s legit, and one that’s meant to confuse.
* Adds strategic bluffing: if you're not the faker, do you help or throw others off?

---

### 7. **Theme Chaos**

* The grid includes **random words from multiple categories**.
* No clear theme, so it’s harder to find subtle, theme-aligned clues.

---

### 8. **Drawing Round (Pictionary Mode)**

* Players must **draw their clue** instead of writing it.
* Faker has to fake it—often hilariously bad drawings give it away.

---

### 9. **Hot Seat Mode**

* One player is picked to **not give a clue**, only to vote.
* Their job is to observe and spot the faker—but they don’t know the word either!
* They win a point if they vote correctly.

---

### 10. **Audience Mode**

* Perfect for streamers or group parties.
* **Spectators** (non-players) can vote too and earn points or give awards like "most suspicious clue."

---

## 🧠 Bonus “Meta” Twists

* **Custom Clue Restriction**: “Your clue must rhyme,” “must be a movie title,” “must use exactly three words.”
* **Role Power-Ups**: Introduce special roles like “Seer” (gets two possible words), “Saboteur” (tries to confuse without being the faker).
* **Word Flip**: The faker sees *a different grid entirely*, and must guess what the real one is based on player clues.
